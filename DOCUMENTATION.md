# Documentation

The htpglue glue documentation is split into 3 parts:

* A [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) for learning the concepts and usage of this framework
* [Detailed api docs](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for reference during development
* [Best practices and FAQs](BEST_PRACTICES_AND_FAQS.md) for some extra information on the project

If a working sample of a project using this framework is more your speed, check out this [simple reference project](example_proj/README.md)
