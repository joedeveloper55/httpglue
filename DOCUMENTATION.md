# Documentation

The htpglue glue documentation is split into 3 parts:

* A [tutorial](https://github.com/joedeveloper55/httpglue/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) for quickly learning the main concepts of this framework. Just pip install httpglue, fire up your python interpreter, and follow along.

* [Detailed api docs](https://github.com/joedeveloper55/httpglue/blob/master/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for reference during development

* [Best practices and FAQs](https://github.com/joedeveloper55/httpglue/blob/master/BEST_PRACTICES_AND_FAQS.md) for some extra information on the project

If a working exemplar using this framework is more your speed, check out this [simple reference project](https://github.com/joedeveloper55/httpglue/blob/master/example_proj/README.md)
